This is the Folder for 2 courses of Canal DotNet called "Xamarin.Forms o Poder do XAML, criando interfaces
incr√≠veis". This course has two partes (almost 5h) and here I'll make anotations and everything else.

HotReload (Free) ou LiveXAML: This are two tools that show the Screen while you're programming. LivePreview.
Nice, while you change your XAML, this tools shows it on the screen. It's really (really) awesome.

FlexLayout: It's an API (or framework) of components based on FlexBox. It's better and perfomatic then the
others components - better than any other option of Grid, StackLayout and everything else.

Templates for Xamarin: We have Templates for Xamarin, like AdminLTE for Web. One of the most famous is called
Grial UI Kit: https://grialkit.com/ (it's a kind of Telerik for Xamarin, very expensive $299 one APP).

We also have Telerik, Syncfusion (opensource).
